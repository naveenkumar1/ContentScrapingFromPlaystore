 Faulty Fingerprint Login I've had this app for a while. However in the past few weeks, the fingerprint login feature has been wonky on my S6 Edge+.  It shows up initially, accepts my fingerprint and then still requires a password.  Other than this small glitch,  the app is perfect.  Full Review  
 BofA is built for life! Great bank, great app! Paperless, mobile banking at my fingertips 24/7! Awesome customer service, (if you ever need them) Peace of mind knowing  my cash is protected, & the ease of depositing check from my phone. Can't beat that.  Full Review  
 I hate bank of America Modern crooks worst bank in existence. Can't wait to get a new account someplace else  Full Review  
  App needs strong connection,  Was crashing for me and support said to  turn on only wifi and it worked fine as I had a strong wifi and weak cellular signal.  I believe it tries cellular first so if you have spotty coverage it will crash when transmitting large chunks....like check photos.  Also a fresh reboot helps. Anyway, works fine on my wifi only while in airplane mode!  Full Review
