 Faulty Fingerprint Login I've had this app for a while. However in the past few weeks, the fingerprint login feature has been wonky on my S6 Edge+.  It shows up initially, accepts my fingerprint and then still requires a password.  Other than this small glitch,  the app is perfect.  Full Review  {

  App needs strong connection,  Was crashing for me and support said to  turn on only wifi and it worked fine as I had a strong wifi and weak cellular signal.  I believe it tries cellular first so if you have spotty coverage it will crash when transmitting large chunks....like check photos.  Also a fresh reboot helps. Anyway, works fine on my wifi only while in airplane mode!  Full Review  {

 Great app Great app that continues to evolve with each update. I remember when the app first launched so many years ago and it was UGLY :) IF I could make one request, it'd be great to add support for the fingerprint API to create a faster sign-in experience. Fingerprint readers will be the norm with the 2016 flagships and with current Nexus devices having them, I think it's a must.  Full Review  {

 Mostly good But I miss finger print sign in moving to my nexus 6p. It's been months now, is it really so hard to implement a built-in api? Other than that, its good and useful. 5 stars when I get finger print back. Edit: Your app help section on fingerprint signin currently states fingerprint support on Android and ios. This should be changed to Samsung Galaxy devices instead of Android until you support the official Android api.  Otherwise it's misleading.  Full Review  {

 Falls short of expectations The fingerprint access is a great feature, but i would like to have a widget i can view my balance at all times because once your done anx you back out if you dont log off it will reopen 5 minutes later to announce it has logged you out and you need to relogin well thats dumb because then once i close it will just do it again sl either stay open and allow me access to info or stop interupting me sometimes im doing something important and relogin to access my account just interupted a payement  Full Review  {

  My only complaint is that it doesn't show the bill pay history,  so for recurring payments I can't see what I paid before,  which is annoying. Besides that,  offers all the functionality of the website plus fingerprint signin, which is nice (though it doesn't always work).  Update: just after posting this I used the app and noticed it now shows the previous payment amount in the Bill Pay section. A big improvement--upgrading to 5 stars.  Full Review  {

 Camera on Samsung Note 5 When performing a check deposit, the camera allows the front side of the check to be photographed with no issues, but when doing the same to the backside, it continually says that there is not enough light.

  Banked here for almost 30 years. Gets worse every year. They cancelled their message center, now NO ONLINE CORRESPONDENCE PERMITTED. Call center a nightmare. Ignorant reps dominate. Of course they're paid nothing. Time to look elsewhere. Watch out for fees! Check your statements carefully. No sense of customer service here; customers are adversaries. The app is but a symptom of policy which avoids human contact with bank employees at all costs with good reason. Chat sessions are little better as these reps are working multiple chat sessions simultaneously while the customer WAITS AND WAITS as on BRIEF HOLD telephonically. And we bailed this bank?

 Great App! I use it all of the time, to stay on top of my balance. It's very convenient and easy to use! As a former employee (for 9 years) I have kept my accounts with B of A for two reasons, one: convenient banking options (mobile, online) & two: the small banking atmosphere in my local banking centers (Santa Fe, NM). They know me and treat me like family! That feels good when you're taking care of someone's money. People work hard for it and they want to know that it's being looked after by someone you TRUST!

 Could be better The app wouldn't let me log in last night without updating it when I just updated it within the last two weeks. Then tonight it wouldn't let me log in because it says that mobile banking is temporarily. I tried logging in using using Chrome on my galaxy s5 and it worked just fine. They still haven't fixed the issue where if you forget to log out of the app after you're done using it, it will alert you and bring you to the log out screen even if you're busy in another app or Web browser.

 Helpful banking app, but the size... The app is incredibly helpful, as it's great to have easy access to all banking needs. But 25mbs for the latest update? That's just ridiculous. And to make it where I can't use the app unless I do update, it put me in a bit of a tough spot.  Full Review  {

 Very useful app! This app is great to check in on the status of your accounts. Some of the menu's are similar to the one's you see if you login from your PC.

 Inaccurate. Make sure low income individuals don't rely on current balance when using the app, especially when having automatic payments withdrawn. It will overdraw your account with a $35 fee. Rely on your own registrar balance for EVERY transaction.  Full Review  {

 Great app,except for one thing. Still no fingerprint support! Honestly I never have issues... Except now I have a Nexus 6P and can't use fingerprint security. This is outrageous seeing as how the api for this was available almost a year ago as part of a developer preview. Get it together BofA! Makes me want to switch to   Chase Bank. Sending template responses to bad reviews doesn't make you look any better than not responding at all.

  Generally people who buy the cream of the crop in the cell phone market expect the best features, the best apps and the most utility out of their phone. Unfortunately Bank of America doesn't  think the Nexus 6p is worth their time or attention when it comes to the fingerprint scanner. BOA, get your head on straight and include the flagship android phone in your application. I'll update my review when you update your application.  Full Review  {

 Missing some features This app would be great if I was able to view my Cash Rewards balance on my credit card.

Thanks BoA   What are the developers doing...??? app used to work just fine, I was even taking about how much better its getting with each new release--until now!! what have you guys done--auto picture taking does NOT work. I have to let the app fail (as I am holing phone in an impossible angle) at taking a picture, turn off light and then manually take it.  Please release one without auto picture ASAP--thanks.

 Not so good. Had originally rated this app a 4 star, now it's down to 1 since a major issue is still left unfixed. I get that I have been "signed out for my security" but there is no reason for the app to take priority over what I'm doing and pop up right while I'm in the middle of something.

 Ancient and useless Compared to other banks it is very limited but the worst is their need for constant updates. I was somewhere with no land lines and no cell phone towers (no companies in the area), and the only connection was an extremely slow wifi  (dl at 100kbps). Couldn't choose to update later as they force you no matter what, and I ended up spending over an hour with all the lost connections for a simple transfer.  So I had to drive an hour to town to get a signal, and ended up with 4 hours wasted that day thx to BofA.  Full Review  {

 Decent I like the app but it doesn't let me reset my pin on my debit card, I have to go into the branch which is awful.  I like convenience, so I don't want to go into the branch.  Also, I would like to activate a budget or financial goal through the app.  I can open an account from the app but can't reset my pin or look at my goals or budget , why? I know it can be done because other banks do it.  You guys are supposed to be the leaders of innovation but maybe I give you to much credit.  Full Review  {

 Update bugged. Every log in it makes me set same challenge questions Whenever I log in now it says my account has been locked. Fine, so I have it send me a code through my verified method. But then it takes me to a screen to set the value of challenge question answers. It does this every time. It never asks me for the correct answers just to set the answers. Doesn't sound very secure. Additionally when the session end warning pops up it should not then interrupt whatever you may be doing and take you back to the blank password login screen.  Full Review  {

 Update ruined check depositing The BofA app had been really good but the last update made it nearly impossible to deposit checks. It grabs the image of the check before the camera has a chance to focus, causing it to get blurry images every time. This could have caused huge problems because it took several days before BofA told me that my paycheck deposit had been denied. When I tried to deposit it again, I realized what was going on. They should bring back a button to allow manually taking the check pictures.  Full Review  {

 App is HORRIBLE after update!!! Has too many tweaks. Unable to make transfers, view purchases, and change settings. Takes forever to load. Anytime I try to click on something, the app automatically restarts and logs me out.

  Where are the fingerprints?  Such an application is basically un-useable without fingerprints security but I can't find how to make this work on my Nexus 5x.

 This app has steadily improved It's still got its UX quirks, but it does what it needs to do. I kinda like the older way of depositing checks - I feel like I have less control of the camera now. We have native fingerprint APIs now with Android 6.0, so I'll be waiting for support on the Nexus 6P. Edit: any update on the status of native fingerprint API support (aka Nexus Phones)? A couple of updates have been pushed out already with no new support.  Full Review  {

 Great, but fingerprint login isn't working. One of my favorite features with this app was logging in using my fingerprint. As of the past week this feature no longer works, it prompts you to enter the fingerprint and then after you do, you still have to log in with your password.  Full Review  {

 I am revising an earlier review I left a 1 star comment earlier when I had random inability to log in at all. I since have a new phone (Nexus 5x) & the error isn't happening, I can log in typing my pw, but why I still keep it no better than 3 is because now I no longer have the fingerprint option.
